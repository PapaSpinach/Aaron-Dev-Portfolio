# Aaron-Dev-Portfolio
I am building a developer portfolio that contains a single page.
It contains navigation links that takes you to different sections, about me, work, and contact me.
In my portfolio, I will be flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
Used Meyers Reset for CSS http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/notes/week4/reset.css
